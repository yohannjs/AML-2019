        "\n",
        "**IPython** (Interactive Python) is originally developed for Python. Now, it is a command shell for interactive computing supporting multiple programming languages. It offers rich media, shell syntax, tab completion, and history. IPython is based on an architecture that provides parallel and distributed computing. IPython enables parallel applications to be developed, executed, debugged and monitored interactively.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Jupyter Notebooks** are a web-based interactive computational environment for creating IPython notebooks. An IPython notebook is a JSON document containing an ordered list of input/output cells which can contain code, text, mathematics, plots and rich media. Notebooks make data analysis easier to perform, understand and reproduce. All laboratories in this course are prepared as Notebooks. As you can see, in this Notebook, we can put text, images, hyperlinks, source code... The Notebooks can be converted to a number of open standard output formats (HTML, HTML presentation slides, LaTeX, PDF, ReStructuredText, Markdown, Python) through `File` -> `Download As` in the web interface. In addition, Jupyter manages the notebooks' versions through a `checkpoint` mechanism. You can create checkpoint anytime via `File -> Save and Checkpoint`. \n",
        "\n",
        "**NOTE on Checkpointing:** in this course, we use a peculiar environment to work. We don't have a Notebook server: instead, we create on demand clusters with a Notebook front-end. Since your clusters are **ephemeral** (they are terminated after a predefined amount of time), checkpointing is of little use, for anything else than saving your notebook in your ephemeral environment. It is far better to download regularly your notebooks, and to push them to your git repository."
